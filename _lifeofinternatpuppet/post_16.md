Hello Everyone!

Not too long to Christmas now, of course?

This has been the busiest week of my placement so far, before the team wraps up for Christmas holidays!

Some of the key highlights included:-

**Module Release Prep**
- [puppetlabs-motd (IAC-1308)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1308)
- [puppetlabs-tomcat (IAC-1330)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1330)
- [puppetlabs-tagmail (IAC-1349)](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1349)

**Module Releases**
-[puppetlabs-accounts](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/accounts) (v6.4.0)
-[puppetlabs-concat](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/concat) (v6.4.0)
-[puppetlabs-service](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/service) (v1.4.0)
-[puppetlabs-docker](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/docker) (v3.13.0)

I have also merged lots of PR's on the Triage Day on Monday.

I had raised a [PR](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-modules/pull/10183) to be added to the user groups for doing local testing for the complicated modules such as [puppetlabs-websphere](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-websphere_application_server)
