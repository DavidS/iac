The IAC team has been working on a lot of things over the past week.
We want to share with our community some of the most interesting things.
Here’s a brief overview of what we’ve been up to:

## Module Releases from IAC Team
We've had a few modules released this week:
- [puppetlabs/acl](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-acl) (v3.2.0)
- [puppetlabs/accounts](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts) (v6.2.0)
- [puppetlabs/pwshlib](https://github.com/puppetlabs/ruby-pwsh) (v0.5.0)

## Team work, dream work
We've noticed that simplecov dropped support for Ruby 2.4 from v0.19.0 and in order to solve this problem which was first highlighted [here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/issues/345), all the team put their resourcers in one debug session. Step by step, we were able to understand what is happening and short after that, [puppet-module-gems](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-module-gems)(v0.5.1) was released.
Thank you [Paula](https://github.com/pmcmaw), [Ciaran](https://github.com/sanfrancisko) and [Dani](https://github.com/carabasdaniel) for the demonstration! 

## Community Contributions
We'd like to thank the fantastic Puppet Community for the following contributions over the past week:

- [puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache): Thanks to [ekohl][ekohl] for this [fix](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2060) which ensures that the bool2httpd function is compatible in Ruby 2.7.
- [puppetlabs/puppet-strings](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings): [ekohl][ekohl] also provided this [fix](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings/pull/246) to ensure that we handle missing descriptions more gracefully in puppet-strings, thanks again [ekohl][ekohl]!
- [puppetlabs/action-litmus-spec](https://github.com/puppetlabs/action-litmus_spec): This update to the README should hopefully make things a bit clearer for anyone else wishing to leverage the action-litmus-spec Github Action, thanks for the [fix](https://github.com/puppetlabs/action-litmus_spec/pull/38) [choffee][choffee]!
- [puppetlabs/pdk-docker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-docker): Thank you [alanraison][alanraison] for the [fix](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-docker/pull/10) to pdk-docker which ensures openssh is now installed during container initialisation.

A BIG applause for this week and the community:
[ekohl]:                      https://github.com/ekohl
[choffee]:                    https://github.com/choffee
[alanraison]:                 https://github.com/alanraison

## Time for holiday
As no summer can't end without a holiday, our team members Daiana and Dani will have a short PTO for recharging their batteries and prepare for a new season of fixing bugs! 

## Wrap-up
That’s it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.
