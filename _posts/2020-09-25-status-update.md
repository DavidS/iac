## Community Contributions

We'd like to thank the following people in the Puppet Community for their contributions over this past week:

- Thanks to [jcpunk][jcpunk] for the tidy up effort to resolve `puppet-lint` and `yamllint` warnings across the following repos:
  - [`puppetlabs-concat#660`][puppetlabs-concat-pr-660]
  - [`puppetlabs-kubernetes#438`][puppetlabs-kubernetes-pr-438]
  - [`puppetlabs-stdlib#1127`][puppetlabs-stdlib-pr-1127]
  - [`puppetlabs-translate#93`][puppetlabs-translate-pr-93]
- [`puppetlabs-postgresql#1187`][puppetlabs-postgresql-pr-1187]: Thanks to [ekohl][ekohl] for the enhancement that allows you to remove config entries by setting them to `undef` - a very useful addition!
