<p>The IAC team has been working on a lot of things over the past week.
We want to share with our community some of the most interesting things.
Here’s a brief overview of what we’ve been up to:</p>

<h2 id="module-releases-from-iac-team">Module Releases from IAC Team</h2>
<p>We’ve had a few modules released this week:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-acl">puppetlabs/acl</a> (v3.2.0)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts">puppetlabs/accounts</a> (v6.2.0)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/ruby-pwsh">puppetlabs/pwshlib</a> (v0.5.0)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib">puppetlabs/stdlib</a> (v6.4.0)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-motd">puppetlabs/motd</a> (v4.2.0)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="team-work-dream-work">Team work, dream work</h2>
<p>We’ve noticed that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simplecov</code> dropped support for Ruby 2.4 from v0.19.0 and in order to solve this problem which was first highlighted <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/issues/345">here</a>, all the team put their resources in one debug session. Step by step, we were able to understand what is happening and shortly after that, <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-module-gems">puppet-module-gems</a>(v0.5.1) was released.
Thank you <a href="https://github.com/pmcmaw">Paula</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sanfrancisko">Ciaran</a> and <a href="https://github.com/carabasdaniel">Dani</a> for the demonstration!</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v0.5.1</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">puppet-module-gems</code> for Ruby 2.7 on Windows has not yet been uploaded to <a href="https://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> - we are working to get this resolved a.s.a.p.</p>

<h2 id="community-contributions">Community Contributions</h2>
<p>We’d like to thank the fantastic Puppet Community for the following contributions over the past week:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache">puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache</a>: Thanks to [ekohl][ekohl] for this <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/2060">fix</a> which ensures that the bool2httpd function is compatible in Ruby 2.7.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings">puppetlabs/puppet-strings</a>: [ekohl][ekohl] also provided this <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings/pull/246">fix</a> to ensure that we handle missing descriptions more gracefully in puppet-strings, thanks again [ekohl][ekohl]!</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/action-litmus_spec">puppetlabs/action-litmus-spec</a>: This update to the README should hopefully make things a bit clearer for anyone else wishing to leverage the action-litmus-spec Github Action, thanks for the <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/action-litmus_spec/pull/38">fix</a> [choffee][choffee]!</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-docker">puppetlabs/pdk-docker</a>: Thank you [alanraison][alanraison] for the <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-docker/pull/10">fix</a> to pdk-docker which ensures openssh is now installed during container initialisation.</li>
</ul>

<p>A BIG applause for this week and the community:
[ekohl]:                      https://github.com/ekohl
[choffee]:                    https://github.com/choffee
[alanraison]:                 https://github.com/alanraison</p>

<h2 id="dsc-builder-nearing-testing">DSC Builder Nearing Testing</h2>

<p>Lots of small issues have been closed out recently for the DSC work - paths and non enum values are now case-insensitive, DscRunAsCredential now works as expected, and the base provider lives in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwshlib</code> (check the latest release) meaning you don’t have to rebuild your modules every time the base provider gets updated or improved!</p>

<p>The tickets closed out this week represent the last technical implementation blockers for this phase of the project, everything else is documentation, testing, and user feedback! We’re nearing a launch of the PowerShell module to the <a href="https://powershellgallery.com">public Gallery</a>!</p>

<h2 id="time-for-holiday">Time for holiday</h2>
<p>As no summer can end without a holiday, our team members Daiana and Dani will have a short PTO for recharging their batteries and prepare for a new season of fixing bugs!</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>That’s it for this weeks update, a big THANK YOU for all your contributions and support.</p>
